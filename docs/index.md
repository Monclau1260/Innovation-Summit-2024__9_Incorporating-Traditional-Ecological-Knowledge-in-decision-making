# Group 9 -- Incorporating Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in decision-making
Summary :
The team introductions included members of the existing ESIIL working groups. We have people with a significant amount of superpowers in AI, data processing, computer systems, collaborative work, data collection, mapping, coding, engineering, wireless interconnection hardware and software,teaching, academics, and climate data. There are observations about how to communicate climate challenges to traditional communities and how to explain ecological knowledge, as this traditional knowledge in most of the communities is passed through traditions instead of a system-based structure. The concept of cosmos and traditional knowledge is integral and interconnected, and the general idea is to guide people to a living purpose.Traditional knowledge includes practices, memorization,oral traditions and many other untangibles. 

The main discussion was about protecting and preserving traditional and inherent language knowledge through data sovereignty.
